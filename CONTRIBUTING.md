## issues

unlike the upstream pyright repo, we are very open to ideas for improvements and bug reports. if you've raised an issue on the upstream pyright repo that was closed without a solution, feel free to raise it again here.

please upvote issues you find important using the üëç react. we don't close issues that don't get enough upvotes or anything like that. this is just to help us prioritize which issues to address first.
