# why?

there are two primary reasons for this fork:

1. pyright lacks many features which are made exclusive to pylance, microsoft's closed-source extension that cannot be used outside of vscode
2. pyright lacks functionality that the maintainer does not consider to be important, but we believe are essential for a python type checker

see the [Benefits over Pyright](./benefits-over-pyright/new-diagnostic-rules.md) section for a comprehensive list of new features and improvements we've made to pyright.
