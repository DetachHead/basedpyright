# why?

there are two main reasons for this fork:

1. pyright lacks many features which are made exclusive to pylance, microsoft's closed-source vscode extension
2. the maintainer of pyright [closes valid issues for no reason and lashes out at users](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/8065#issuecomment-2146352290)

see the [Benefits over Pyright](./benefits-over-pyright/new-diagnostic-rules.md) section for a comprehensive list of new features and improvements we've made to pyright.
