# why?

there are two main reasons for this fork:

1. pyright is lacking several features that are made exclusive to pylance, microsoft's closed-source vscode extension
2. the maintainer of pyright [closes valid issues for no reason and lashes out at users](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/8065#issuecomment-2146352290)

i wanted a python type checker and language server that \*actually works. not just for my own sake, but for the benefit of the community. this section contains a mostly comprehensive list of the the new features and improvements we've built on top of pyright.

see the [Benefits over Pyright](./benefits-over-pyright/new-diagnostic-rules.md) section for a comprehensive list of new features and improvements we've made to pyright.
