-   :material-microsoft-visual-studio-code:{ .lg .middle } **Pylance features in any editor**

    ***

    basedpyright re-implements many features exclusive to pylance - microsoft's closed-source extension that can't be used outside of vscode.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: more info](./benefits-over-pyright/pylance-features.md)

-   :material-language-python:{ .lg .middle } **New type checking rules**

    ***

    basedpyright introduces over 10 new diagnostic rules to catch potentially serious issues in your code that would otherwise go completely undetected by pyright.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: more info](./benefits-over-pyright/new-diagnostic-rules.md)

-   :simple-pypi:{ .lg .middle } **Easy to install**

    ***

    unlike pyright, using the basedpyright CLI doesn't require you to install nodeJS. just install it from PyPI like all your other dependencies.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: more info ](./benefits-over-pyright/pypi-package-vscode-pinning.md#pypi-package-no-nodejs-required)

-   :octicons-checklist-16:{ .lg .middle } **Baseline support**

    ***

    adopt basedpyright's stricter type checking rules effortlessly in an existing project. no need to update any of your old code

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: more info ](./benefits-over-pyright/baseline.md)

-   :octicons-terminal-16:{ .lg .middle } **Consistent between the editor and CLI**

    ***

    the basedpyright vscode extension will use the version of the PyPI package installed to your environment by default, so you never see different errors
    in your editor and the CLI

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: more info ](./benefits-over-pyright/pypi-package-vscode-pinning.md#ability-to-pin-the-version-used-by-vscode)

-   :octicons-issue-reopened-16:{ .lg .middle } **Open to feedback**

    ***

    unlike pyright, we listen to what the users want. if you encounter any problems or have an idea for a new feature, don't hesitate to open an issue.
