a version of [basedpyright](https://docs.basedpyright.com) that can be run in a browser.

unless you have a specific reason to use the browser build, it's recommended to install basedpyright from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/basedpyright/) instead. see [the installation instructions](https://docs.basedpyright.com/#/installation?id=command-line-amp-language-server) for more information.

this build was adapted from the abandoned [microbit-foundation pyright fork](https://github.com/microbit-foundation). more information on how to use it is available in [their documentation](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/pyright/blob/microbit/THIS_FORK.md).

## disclaimer

this version of pyright was in an unfinished state when i found it. i've done my best to merge the last 2 years of pyright updates into it, but i can't promise it will work anywhere outside of [the basedpyright playground](https://basedpyright.com). if you have a use case for running basedpyright in the browser and run into issues with this package, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright/issues/new)
